## Features

2. **Add to Server**: Place the downloaded JAR file into the `plugins` directory of your Minecraft server.
3. **Download PacketEvents**: Obtain the latest version of PacketEvents and place the JAR file into the `plugins` directory.
4. **Restart Server**: Restart your Minecraft server to load the plugins.
